- add C++11
- find out what happened to System.Numerics.dll
- fix --prefix for /_reload and sign in request when submitting
- test submissions from last years contest (after diff limit has been implemented), make sure verdicts are similar
- implement judge interface on the server
- make sure setup scripts work on ubuntu

DONE:
- set a limit on the max number of lines shown in diff (otherwise difflib is really slow)
